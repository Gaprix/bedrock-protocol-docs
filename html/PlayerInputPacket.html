<td>The desired local space move direction of the player in the vehicle. Convert this to world space by rotating by `mRot.y` along the Y (up) axis.<br>The server authoritative near-equivalent is PlayerAuthInputPacket::mMove with the only difference being that this is scaled by expected movement slowdowns like sneaking and using items.</td>
</tr><tr><td>Jumping</td>
<td>True if the player is holding down the jump input or is auto-jumping.<br>In server authoritative movement this is equivalent to `PlayerAuthInputPacket::InputData::Jumping` bit.</td>
</tr><tr><td>Sneaking</td>
<td>This is either the predicted sneak state as determined by sneak input or the latest value received from `SetActorDataPacket` depending on timing.<br>In server authoritative movement the closest equivalent is `PlayerAuthInputPacket::InputData::Sneaking` and does not have the timing issue.</td>
