<td><br>In server authoritative movement mode the client supplies this in PlayerAuthInputPacket.<br>For any client-bound packets containing a tick, the server should supply the tick value corresponding to the most recently processed PlayerAuthInputPacket.<br>This allows the client to adjust any client predictions made while the packet was in flight.<br>If the packet is being sent to the client but not relating to data of the player or a client-predicted vehicle, it can be zero.<br>It is also acceptable to specify zero for players, although this may lead to minor visual flickers and less smooth application of CorrectPlayerMovePredictionPacket.<br></td>
